# HR Data Cleaning & Workforce Demographics Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project showcases my **advanced SQL skills** by cleaning and analyzing an HR dataset. The primary focus is **data cleaning, standardization, and workforce demographic analysis**, highlighting my ability to work with real-world messy data and extract meaningful insights.

##  Goals & Objectives
- **Data Cleaning & Standardization:**
  - Remove duplicate records
  - Standardize column formats and naming conventions
  - Convert text-based dates to proper `DATE` format
  - Handle missing values appropriately
- **Workforce Analysis:**
  - Age distribution of employees
  - Diversity breakdown by race
  - Department sizes and gender imbalances
  - Employee tenure and attrition patterns
  - Pay zone distribution by gender and race
  - Impact of tenure on pay levels

##  SQL Techniques Used
✅ **CTEs & Window Functions** (ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY) for duplicate detection and removal  
✅ **Data Type Conversion** (e.g., `TEXT` to `DATE`)  
✅ **CASE Statements** for categorizing age groups and tenure brackets  
✅ **Aggregation & Percentage Calculations** (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `ROUND()`)  
✅ **Joins & Filtering** for data validation and missing value detection  

##  Key Findings
- **Age Distribution:** Majority of employees are **65+ (31.87%)**, while only **2.40% are under 25**.
- **Diversity:** Race distribution is fairly balanced.
- **Department Size:** **Production is the largest department**, while **Executive Office is the smallest**.
- **Gender Imbalance:** **Executive Office (95.83% male)** and Sales/Production show significant imbalances.
- **Tenure & Attrition:** **97.46% of employees leave within 3 years**.
- **Pay Zone Distribution:** Fairly even across gender and race.
- **Tenure vs. Pay:** No significant correlation between tenure and pay level.

- `hr_cleaning.sql` → Full SQL script for data cleaning & transformations
- `hr_analysis.sql` → SQL queries for workforce demographic insights
- `README.md` → This project documentation

##  Next Steps (Future Work)
- Visualize insights using **Power BI/Tableau** for better storytelling.
- Explore deeper trends, such as **performance scores vs. attrition**.
- Compare hiring trends over time (if applicable).

##  Why This Matters for Data Analytics Roles
This project demonstrates my ability to **clean, analyze, and extract insights** from messy HR data from Kaggle using **advanced SQL techniques**. These are essential skills for **data analysts** working with business intelligence, HR analytics, and workforce planning.
